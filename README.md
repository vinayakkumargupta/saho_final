High Alert Mode is available only for the E - Helmet which houses a Bluetooth 5.0 Connectivity. The E-Helmet will have inbuilt speakers which adjusts volume according to speed of the rider and other factors. It will also host a cam for object detection and VR mapping on the user’s Device . S.A.H.O is personalized and Ad-Free , with consumer privacy in mind.

# Innovation

 
1.EMERGENCY & SAFETY ASSISTANCE 
 SOS Alert notifies your emergency contacts of your present position in the event that your safety is in jeopardy and ensures medical assistance at the earliest .
The accelerometer and gyroscope will detect a certain change in both speed and direction in which case after  the 3-second warning countdown, registered emergency contacts in the app, and the medical services nearby will have a distress beacon containing user data , location and time.
 
2. Fuel Gauge Assistance 
This utility shows all available hotspots where the user can refuel most efficiently, it will also have the updated price of the fuel. (Petrol and Diesel)/L. This also suggests refilling fuel to avoid scenarios where running out of said fuel may result in a delay in the journey. 
By calculating the journey plan and amount of fuel , it also suggests if the user may need an extra canister of fuel .
Hands-on information about prices in fuel from Organize your favorite cities by pinning them for easy access.
 
3. VR simulator 
An image recognition program that synchronizes UPI codes to Petrol Pump Icons in the direction you are looking at , all at your mobile application making it easier to make payments , find hotspots, restaurants and all such  utilities. 
 
4. The monitor 
A huge database containing the speed limit of a growing number of roads , the AI enabled voice assistant dedicated to SAHO will advice bikers to be alert in view and keep in check the speed of the ride to said safety limit. The continuous  monitoring will be displayed as a visual representation  for the riders to understand breach  of safety rules .
The monitor is solely responsible to impact alertness and avoid carelessness / haste while driving a vehicle .
 



How it will be different from similar existing solutions. *
The indirect competitors constitute of solutions only for the android users (unavailable to IOS)  and the solutions are not automated ! 
The Indirect Competitors are :
SOS EMERGENCY APP : After entering the numbers manually in the event of an accident, one has to open the app and press a button which then calls the said contact. 
DAILY PETROL is an application that displays prices of data in a respective area.
CRASHGUARD: Manually needs to send  SOS in the event of an accident to a group of contacts.
 
SAHO is an AI-enabled automated response system which detects  a sudden spike from the accelerometer and nonlinear data from the gyroscope, which sends an automated distress beacon after a 5-second Countdown.
The Beacon will have the longitude and latitude of the user’s current location , name , blood type , gender, and age to nearby medical facilities or 102.
SAHO also monitors the fuel gauge and alerts user to refuel on the go , dynamically keeping track of the users surroundings . 

# Ethics, Privacy, Moral and Legal issues related with the SAHO

 
SAHO, a  software that uses the real-time location of the user, we need to have legal, privacy, and safety issues concerning user data encrypted and secured before releasing into the market.

Being an app that needs a lot of user data to function, so data privacy protection comes into play,  we have to abide by all data privacy rules and regulations.

We are even dealing with sensitive issues here, with a very high death rate thus a terms and conditions page issuing that the application is expected to work in the following conditions.  Morality in the functioning of an app for minimizing accident-related issues.

SAHO will use user GPS data, we are obliged to not save or manipulate user data for any other purpose than further optimization of  the app.
